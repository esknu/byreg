## Quarto.

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document.
To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code.
You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).

```{r}
urban <- ilc_lvho01_custom_9256830_linear <- read_csv("ilc_lvho01__custom_9256830_linear.csv", 
    na = "NA")
urban <- urban |> 
  select(-DATAFLOW, -`LAST UPDATE`, -freq, -building, -OBS_FLAG, -building, -incgrp) 

urban <- urban |> 
  select(country = geo, location = deg_urb, year = TIME_PERIOD, Population = OBS_VALUE)
urban <- urban |> 
mutate(location = recode(location,
                           "DEG1" = "City",
                           "DEG2" = "Suburb",
                           "DEG3" = "Rural"))


#deg1 = city, deg2 = towns and suburbs, deg3 = Rural areas
```
