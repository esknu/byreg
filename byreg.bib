  abstract = {This chapter examines observed regional inequalities and centralization tendencies in Norway. Small, rural, municipalities experienced a favourable population development from 1970 to the mid-1980s. After this, the percentage population growth has been strongest in the largest municipalities/cities, and this tendency has accelerated during the last 10{\textendash}15 years. Data post-1970 strongly support the reasonable hypothesis that population growth is positively related to centrality. The major source of changes lies within the labour market regions, whereas the changes between the regions are modest. Jobs have not become more centralized than households over the period.A conceptual model is developed, offering a useful taxonomy of municipalities in three dimensions: the unemployment rate, the employment growth, and housing prices. This provides a classification that contributes to clarify the changes in the urban-rural divide. The discussion demonstrates that distinguishing between different categories is important, since different explanations of centralization and regional disparities call for different menus of policy instruments.We study the relationship between population growth, unemployment rates, and employment growth in Norwegian municipalities, to distinguish between disequilibrium and equilibrium explanations of the situation in regional labour markets. At a national level our results indicate that neoclassical adjustments dominate weakly over amenity-based mechanisms. However, results from many regions support the hypothesis that amenity-based adjustments are dominant for municipalities within a labour market region. One possible explanation is that the diversity in job opportunities is considered as an amenity. A thicker labour market is better fit to meet the demand of workers with specific qualifications.},

This fully revised edition includes key theoretical developments of the last ten years. Topics included span from the earliest location theories to the most recent regional growth theories. It is also is also enriched by the recent debate on smart specialization strategies recently developed by the EU for the design of new cohesion policies.  Key elements covered in the new edition include: proximity and innovation theories the concept of territorial capital  the debate on the role of agglomeration economies in urban growth This textbook is for undergraduate students in regional and urban economics as well as spatial planning courses.},

  abstract = {The challenges to achieve balanced territorial development are often related to the predominance of spatial concentration processes, lack of awareness of local potential and critical mass in remote regions. Despite this large-scale picture, increasingly development problems are observed also in more ``centrally-located'' regions of Europe necessitating a much finer grained level of spatial analysis. The resulting perception of Inner Peripheries in recent years pose several critical questions for the evaluation and planning of the European regional development policy and practice. This is particularly due to their nature, i.e. peripherality and marginality, which might instigate local population feelings of being treated `unfair' and, at the same time, to the relatively poor attention given by EU policy and scientific frameworks to these remote territories. Recent studies have highlighted the need for reflecting local distinctive challenges and pathways in different types of rural regions. Through adopting an interdisciplinary approach with robust and finer level analyses and multi-stakeholder processes, the Academic studies and policy strategies should pool their strengths towards understanding and devising actions for mitigation of the underlying problems, making use of European and National Funds also for affected Inner Peripheries.},

  abstract = {Here we evaluate the time trends of urban-rural differences in physical activity in the European Union between 2002 and 2017 and the contribution of urbanization on total physical activity changes, using four Eurobarometer surveys (n~=~101,373). Trajectories of urban-rural differences in physical activity varied considerably among EU-28 countries. Hierarchical linear regression models revealed that inactivity increased in both urban and rural settings, although it was higher in the latter. Thereby, the urban-rural gap diminished and was even eliminated in some countries. Also, national changes across time were driven by urban places, showing little contribution from urbanization. Our findings suggest that inactivity has risen in Europe regardless of living environments and with regional urbanization development having little influence.},
